# Data Analysis with Python Project
## Exploratory Analysis of Thanksgiving Data using Pandas

### Objective:
  The aim of this project is to find common patterns in Thanksgiving data using pandas.

### Dataset:
  Data set came from [fivethirtyeight](http://fivethirtyeight.com) and  contains 1058 responses to an online survey about what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner. Each survey respondent was asked questions about what they typically eat for Thanksgiving, along with some demographic questions, like their gender, income, and location. This dataset will allow us to discover regional and income-based patterns in what Americans eat for Thanksgiving dinner.

### Analyses
  * The dataset is explored using python pandas. I explored:
  - The number of people who celebrate the Thanksgiving
  - Main dishes in the Thanksgiving menu
  - Common desserts at Thanksgiving dinner
  - Age distribution of Thanksgiving participants
  - Income distribution of Thanksgiving participants
  - Relationship between Income Level and Travel Distance of the Participants
